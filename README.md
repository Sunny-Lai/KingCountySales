# King County Housing Sales

## Objective
In this project, I analyzed housing sales within King county, WA by creating a multiple linear regression model utilizing python. Multiple logistic regression will allow for a detailed analysis that can provide insight into what factors impact the price of housing within King County. Utilizing data analysis provides quantitative evidence to support our research question. By determining what housing factors impact price the most, we can predict a price range for prospective homebuyers. I present my demographic findings in a Tableau Dashboard published to Tableau Public found here: [King County Housing Sales Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/KingCountyHouseSales_17029447909060/KingCountyHouseSales?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
